## Basic Usage and Some Basic Control files
1. Basic Usage:
```sh
run_alchemd -p protein.prmtop -c protein.rst7 -i input.txt > mdout 2>&1
```
where protein.prmtop is the amber style topology file, protein.rst7 is the amber style coordinate file (could be protein.prmcrd files, but the suffix need to be changed to .rst7), and input.txt is the input control file.

2. Some Basic Control files:
- lambdas.json:
```json
{
    "res_lambda": 
    {
        "lambda_restraints": [0.0, 1.0], 
        "lambda_electrostatics": [1.0, 1.0], 
        "lambda_sterics": [1.0, 1.0]
    }, 
    "cal_mbar_lambda": 
    {
        "lambda_restraints": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], 
        "lambda_electrostatics": [1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0], 
        "lambda_sterics": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
    }
}
```
The lambdas.json file contains the lambda values for the defined states (whose names are defined as the "lambdas_json" option in the input.txt file). There may be multiple lambda dictionaries in the file. The user can use the "lambdas_group" option in the input.txt file to specify which lambda dictionary to use.
**Note:** For OpenMM, when the lambda_electrostatics and lambda_sterics values are set to 1.0, the ligand will be fully interacting with the environment with electrostatics and vdW interactions. When the lambda_electrostatics and lambda_sterics values are set to 0.0, the interaction between the ligand and environment will be fully turned off. However, for molecular dynamics simulation software like Gromacs, the definition of interaction states corresponding to lambda_electrostatics and lambda_sterics values of 1 and 0 is exactly opposite to that of OpenMM. To maintain consistency with Gromacs and similar software, the output files (state_s*.csv) generated by Alchemd adopt the same definition as Gromacs regarding the relationship between λ values and interaction states. However, in the lambdas.json file that serves as input for OpenMM, the OpenMM-style definition of interaction states corresponding to λ=1 or 0 is retained.

**Note:** 
Although pdbx files are similar to pdb files, pdbx files are parsed using spaces as delimiters. Each atom occupies one line, and each line primarily contains the following information: atom number (which must correspond to the atom numbers in the prmtop and rst7 files being used), atom name, residue name, residue number, and x, y, z coordinates. (This information largely corresponds to what's available in pdb files).
However, pdbx files contain two additional types of information. One is the vdW annihilation group that each atom belongs to (corresponding to current_group_nb), which is specified in the last column of each space-delimited line. The other additional information consists of all floating-point numbers between the z-coordinate and the last element, which are parsed and combined into a list. We refer to this list as the charge information for each atom. We can specify the charge information for the initial state using current_group_chg (starting from 1), and use the charge information from column (current_group_chg+1) as the target state's charge information.
The control functionality for charge information is currently in beta development.
